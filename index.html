    <h1>Computer Science, Curiosity & Impact</h1>

    <p>
      I’m a student researcher and builder interested in how computation intersects
      with education, science, finance, and public systems. My work spans AI/ML research,
      cryptography, ed-tech platforms, and community-driven initiatives.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-quote">
      I’m most drawn to the spaces between disciplines - where structure meets curiosity.
